# *** algoDesign map
## Lec 01: intro to algos and stable matching problem
- [[algorithm design process]]
- specific algo learned during the course
	- greedy
	- divide and conquer
	- dynamic programming
	- network flows
- [[stable matching problem]]
	- [[Gale Shapley Algorithm]]

## Lecture 02: Basic of Algorithm Analysis
- [[algorithm analysis & efficiency & worst case runtime]]
	- [[big-o notation]]
	- [[big-omega notation]]
	- [[big-theta notation]]



## Greedy Algo 1
- coin changing
	- cons of greedy: only care about present, not the future; lack of backtracking!!
- interval scheduling
- interval partitioning
- scheduling to minimal lateness
- [[huffman coding]]
- [[Depth First Search - DFS]]
