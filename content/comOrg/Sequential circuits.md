## sequential circuit vs combinational circuit
- Combinational: Output depends only on current input
- Sequential: 
	- Output depends on current inputs + state variables (past history of the circuit, hold by the storage elements)
	- a clock periodically advances the circuit

## types of sequential circuits:
- asynchronous sequential circuits: outputs & state change AS input change
- synchronous sequential circuits: output & state change ONLY WHEN a special input, the [[clock in sequential circuit|clock]], gets a certain value
