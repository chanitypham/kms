## what is CG
- binary CSP: each constraints related (at most) 2 vars
- binary CG: nodes are variables, arcs show constraints
- general-purpose CSP algos use graph structure to speed up search
	- eg. Tasmania is independent subproblem
- CG only show there are constraints, dont tell what the constraints are
