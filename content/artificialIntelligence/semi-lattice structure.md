## what is semi-lattice structure, comparison with tree
- [pic of semi-lattice structure vs tree](https://i.imgur.com/Syvcelf.png)
- 1. **Parent Nodes**: In a tree, each node (except the root) has exactly one parent. This means there’s a single path from the root to any node. In a semi-lattice, a node can have more than one parent, allowing for multiple paths from the root to a node
- 2. **Structure**: A tree has a hierarchical structure, with each level representing a “generation” of nodes. A semi-lattice doesn’t have this strict hierarchy and allows for more complex relationships between nodes
- 3. **Real-world analogy**: A tree is like a family tree where each person has exactly one biological mother and one biological father. A semi-lattice is more like a network of roads in a city, where there are many different routes from one location to another
- **Mathematical Definition**: A semi-lattice is a mathematical structure where any two elements have a greatest lower bound. This is not necessarily the case in a tree.
