## Zero-Sum Games 
- Agents have opposite utilities (values on outcomes) 
- Lets us think of a single value that one maximizes and the other minimizes
- Adversarial, pure competition
- the total sum is always 0 (the lose of someone is the gains of the others)

## General Games 
ยง Agents have independent utilities (values on outcomes) ยง Cooperation, indifference, competition, and more are all possible ยง More later on non-zero-sum games
