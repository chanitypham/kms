- classification of states
	- j accessible from state i if $P_{ij}^n >0$ for some n >= 0
- accessible: move from state i to j after certain of steps
- relation of communication
	- i com with i, i >=0; $P_{ij}^0 = P(X_k = i | X_k = i) = 1$
	- i com with j, then j com with i; there are such m,n such that $P_{ij}^m >0\;and\;P_{ji}^m > 0$ then $j \leftrightarrow i$
	- i com with j, j com with k, then i com with k; $P_{ij}^n > 0, j \leftrightarrow k: P^m_{jk} > 0$
		- P_{ik}^{n+m} - chapman - \sum

---
- two states that communicate -> in the same class
- any 2 classes of states - either identical or disjoint
- irreducible in markov chain if there is only 1 class
- If $A \cup B \neq \varnothing$ then A = B
