## how to forecasting future values in time series
- forecasting by extrapolation: process of estimating beyond original range, the value of a variable, on the basis of its relationship with another variable
- Forecasts of future values should be made as follows.
	- Calculate a trend line using moving averages or regression.
	- Use the trend line to forecast future trend line values.
	- Adjust these values by the average seasonal variation. With the **additive model, add** the variation. With the **multiplicative model, multiply** the trend value by the variation proportion

## note on extrapolation
- extrapolation based on historical data, not including effects of developments -> can be used for short term forecasts for specific areas, where no untypical developments are expected
