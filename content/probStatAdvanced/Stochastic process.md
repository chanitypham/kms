## stochastic process
- $X(t), t∈T$
    - A collection of random variables. For each $t∈T$, $X(t)$ is a random variable
    - The index $t$ is often interpreted as time and $X(t)$ is the **state** of the process at time t
	    - Eg. $X(t)$: total number of students visiting VinUni by time $t$
    - The set T is called the **index set** of the process.
        - when T countable -> the stochastic process has discrete-time
        - when T is an interval of real line -> the stochastic process has continuous-time
    - X(t)∈ [[state space]]
