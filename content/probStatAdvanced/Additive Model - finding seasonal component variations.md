## what is additive model
- additive model: $Y = T + S + R$
- assume random component R is negligible, the seasonal component S is: $S = Y - T$ (de-trended series)
	- Y is the actual time series
	- T is the trend series (moving average)
	- S is the seasonal component (Not included in some models)
	- C is the cyclical component (excluded)
	- R is the random component
