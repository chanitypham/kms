## what is multiplicative model
- $Y = T . S . R$
	- T: original units
	- S & R: percentages
	- if R negligible (R ~1) -> seasonal percentage: $S = Y/T$

## when does multiplicative outperform additive model
- when the trend is increasing or decreasing over time
- Multiplicative is often preferred as it assumes components are dependent on each other
